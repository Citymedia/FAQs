This one image is then resized proportionally for each location. Due to this technique, we favour high quality image sizes. Upload a minimum size of 600x500px.\r\n\r\nThese are the base image sizes displayed on the different parts of ShopLOCALNow. Please be aware that the site is responsive and therefore image sizes change on smaller views. These are the sizes that appear in the different locations.\r\n\r\n- Featured:\t740x300\r\n- List View:\t225x146\r\n- Single View:\t395x500\r\n- Related:\t200x200\r\n\r\nWe only need the recommended size. \r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###What is the ideal banner size for my site? ###\r\n650x120px \r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###What is the ideal logo size for my business directory? ###\r\n\r\nYour logo image needs to have a ratio of 1:1. The minimum is 200x200px.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n[](#smartphone) \r\n### What is the ideal size for images on smartphones?  ###\r\n\r\nThe carousel itself is a set size and uses the image from the advertisement. Considering we receive a wide range of image sizes from our advertisers, the carousel has been built to accommodate the varying sizes. That being said there are no set restrictions on images sizes. Although, the image for each ad is used in several places, larger images are preferred for the ads. \r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###I am doing some shopping for stock photos at the moment. I understand that you'd help me place the images if I need to. If I'd like a somewhat custom or tweaked image based on the stock image, is that a job for you or for me? ###\r\n\r\nImages are typically sent ad ready to us by the client. If your image needs a slight modification, we can certainly help you.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###What is the difference between deal vs ad pages?###\r\n\r\nThe ad page is for any content you would like to advertise. It could be about your academy, your instructors your programs etc. A deal would be something that you are offering with restriction(s). One example is you can try one free class. The restriction here would be that you only receive one. Let's say you had a promo going on \"Get 10% off all classes if you sign up in the month of June\". The restriction would be that the student must sign up in June to get 10%. Sales classify as deals as they are limited as well. That being said, a product would then be something that you offer without restriction ie. Adult Taekwando is an ongoing class that you offer.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###How does the \"Latest\" view work? Is it simply from the last edited view? Or do I assign it? ###\r\n\r\nThe latest view works in recency and randomization because we do have so many advertisers on the system. This means each advertiser will get a fair chance on the front page. In your case, there will only be content from yourself, so the front page will grab 8 of the most recently added or modified.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###How do I view my ad on the front end without having to search for it? ###\r\n\r\nIn the ad view,  top right corner, there is a button to click that says 'view'. This shows you the advertisement on the front end of the website.\r\n\r\nClick on ads/news/events in the left sidebar > Click on an Ad Id number > top right corner > View Ad\r\n\r\n* On a side note, Archive will deactivate the ad.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###I do like the carousel look, how do I start entering things in this area?###\r\n\r\nThe carousel will take the image and the headline and price (for deals) from an ad. You can use the same process for creating an ad to create a new slide in the carousel and just remember to add the \"Featured\" type and appropriate zone when you are finished.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###Where do the carousel items link to and how do I change the link?###\r\n\r\nAll carousel items will link to the advertisement page automatically. This is not a manual feature.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###How many items can I put in the carousel?###\r\n\r\nUse only 4 or 5 items. For each new batch of ads  you put up, remove the featured type from the existing carousel items, otherwise it will take some time for the slider to rotate through all the items.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###I thought I had a carousel and now I don’t, what happened?###\r\n\r\nThe carousel is automatically activated when you set a Featured type to an ad, deal or product. When there is no Featured typed set to any of these, the carousel will disappear.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n### How do I upload an Ad? ###\r\n\r\n1.\tIn the left sidebar, click on Ads/News/Events (here you will be presented with a list of all ads that were uploaded to the system\r\n2.\tClick on “Bulk Upload” or \"Upload New Ad\" and select all images you are going to display. Select multiples by holding ctrl(pc) or command(mac) while selecting your files if you are using the bulk upload or just do it one by one.\r\n3.\tChoose your zone for the listings (just like you did for the advertiser)\r\n4.\tSelect a Start Date and End date for the ad/listing\r\n5.\tClick Upload\r\n\r\n#####You must edit the ad to activate and add features#####\r\n\r\n1.\tClick on the Ad list\r\nFilter the ads by your ads you uploaded today . Select time frame from this dropdown menu.\r\n2.\tSelect the Id number you of the ad you wish to edit (reference the image name)\r\n3.\tClick edit\r\n4.\tAdd a Headline – something that summarizes the ad without being too lengthy\r\n5.\tType in some Action Text (this is your call to action, ex. View This Home or Visit Our Site)\r\n6.\tAdjust the URL. You can insert an email address instead and have someone send you an email directly from our site. This works well for booking appointments/meetings. Make sure there are no spaces before and after the email.\r\n7.\tAdd a type: Start typing in one of these words: commercial, residential, waterfront or  cottage and allow time for a dropdown box to appear. Then select that word from the list. \r\n8.\tClick update the ad\r\n9.\tClick Activate Ad\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###How do I add a deal?###\r\n1. Click on the Ad Id you wish you add the deal to. \r\n2. Scroll down to the section that says Assigned Deals\r\n3.\tClick on Add a deal\r\n4.\tFill out the  product name (this is your headline) and content , and enter a price \r\n5.\tChoose Image file and click Add a deal\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n### Under the \"Type\", how exactly does that work? I know if I type \"Featured\" it adds it to the carousel. But how exactly does it work? Is there a list of reserved keywords for system?###\r\n\r\nYes there is a list of reserved keywords. When you start typing in a word, wait a few seconds and a dropdown will appear and select the appropriate type. As you mentioned, \"Featured\" triggers an event in the carousel. Other words such as 'services', 'events' will trigger categories. There is a very good chance that the word you are thinking of already exists, so make sure to always wait and see what appears in the dropdown list.\r\n\r\nAlso you can use this section to add items to a category. These categories are predetermined and will correspond to the navigation - top right on home page. All content should have one of these category types added so it appears linked on the home page. \r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###Why are there start and end dates on the ads, deals and products?###\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of our business we display the start and end dates to show how long these advertising campaigns are applicable. We can either hide or display the dates but you must choose if you would like to hide all of the dates or show all of them.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n### Should I use a table in the user interface?###\r\n\r\nAs a practice we don't use tables because they aren't responsive and don't resize well for mobile devices. If this is for a schedule you can send it to us and we will recommend the best way to set it up. \r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###Can I remove the title above my ad?###\r\n\r\nThe title text cannot be removed or masked for you specifically. The site has been templated for multiple advertisers.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###I can’t add a link using the interface. Why isn’t it working?###\r\n\r\nMake sure that you have the http:// in the address field.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###Why isn’t my ad showing up on the front end?###\r\n\r\nCheck and make sure that each ad has a Mediapartner and zone checked off. \r\n\r\nSelect a Mediapartner in the dropdown field. Only those Mediapartners in your area are available to you. Wait a few seconds for the zones to appear. Click on the country for a sublist to appear, then click on province and then select the appropriate zones by using the check boxes. Once you select a zone, it will automatically select the province and Canada. \r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\n###My ads show up on my site but not the Mediapartner site. Why is that and how can I get them to appear on the Mediapartner’s site?###\r\n\r\nTo prevent inappropriate ads flowing through to our Mediapartners and for testing purposes, your ads will appear on your site first. To have them appear on your Mediapartner site, let us know by email - ads@shoplocalnow.ca - that you are ready to launch your ads. They will be reviewed and then activated on the Mediapartner site.\r\n\r\n[top](#top)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns please call us at 1-888-879-6085 or email us at info@shoplocalnow.ca.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
